    """
    A generator that takes one or more boolean valued callables to
    check against. Yields when all the conditions are true, otherwise times out.
    Here the maximum call count represents how many times a call should be made
    for the truth values of the given conditions. By default, the generator will
    time out in about 60 seconds.

    Note that with the current implementation, the conditions are evaluated
    serially. A parallel implementation can be done, if needed.

    This generator should not be confused with a proper context manager which
    can only yield once. Thus decorating this generator as a context
    manager shall fail.
