    """Receives input from a connected barcode reader Tango device and executes
    corresponding actions as scripts in the NICOS daemon.

    - Currently recognized barcodes must be in QR-Code format and should
      contain an URI of this format::

         nicos+cmd://Command/arg1/arg2/...

      For example, ::

          nicos+cmd://maw/shutter1/"open"

      to execute `maw(shutter1, "open")`.

    - This device supports assigning shortcuts in the `commandmap` parameter.
      The `Command` in the URI is looked up in the map, and if found, the
      corresponding code is executed, with URI path arguments represented
      by `$0`, `$1` and so forth.

      For example, for this command map ::

         { 'SE': 'NewSetup("$0"); printinfo("Loaded $1 $0")' }

      and this QR-Code content ::

         nicos+cmd://SE/ccr0/cryostat

      NICOS will execute `NewSetup("ccr0"); printinfo("Loaded cryostat ccr0")`.

    Executed commands are run at `USER` level by a special user named like this
    device is called in the setup.
